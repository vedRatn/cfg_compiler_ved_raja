MYCHANGES
---------

In scanner.ll

1) 	Added tokens "if", "else" and "goto" to detect the corresponding keywords in the cfg file.

2) 	Added the token "!" in the Regex for MetaChar

In Parser.yy

1) Modifed Grammar for detection of
	a)  executable_statement_list
		Since we have added two fundamental statements to the program structure namely "if" and "goto" 
		statement, So in order to incorporate them into the program structure we have modified the 
		definition of executable_statement_list.


	b)	assignment_statement
		Since in the grammar of Level-1 there is a possibility of a Relational_Statement on the RHS of
		'=', therefore we have added the grammar which takes into account such a case.

2) Added Grammar rules for four Statements:
	a) if_statement
		This segment deals with the "if statement" when it occurs in the structure of the program. 
		A priliminary example of Control Flow Statements.

	b) goto_statement
		This segment deals with the "goto statement" when it occurs in the structure of the program.
		This basially deals with the redirection of program from one point of execution to a different
		basic_block

	c) relational_statement
		This deals with all binary expressions of equalities and inequalities and is used in the structure
		of an if_statement and assignment_statement

	d) comparator
		This gives the parser tool to identify the 6 binary comparators namely
			i) 		<
			ii)		>
			iii)	<=
			iv)		>=
			v)		==
			vi) 	!=
